SECTION-NAME: Computers and Computer Programs
SECTION-DETAILS: A computer is a universal machine that can be programmed to do anything. A computer program 
is a sequence of steps that a computer can follow to do something useful. It gives us a way to tell the 
computer what steps to take.
SECTION-NAME: Python
SECTION-DETAILS: Python is a programming language. The python interpreter executes and understands the 
programs by running them into a language the computer can understand.
SECTION-NAME: What is a variable?
SECTION-DETAILS: A variable gives names to keep track of values. We can use the variable to create a name and 
use the name to refer to a variable. The way to introduce a variable is using an assignment statement.
SECTION-NAME: The IF Function
SECTION-DETAILS: To use the IF function, type if < expression >: then under that indent and type which will 
define what code is run if the expression is true. If the expression is false it will skip this code. You can 
also define an ELSE statement and code under it which gets executed when the expression is false.
